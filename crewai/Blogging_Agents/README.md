CrewAI is a cutting-edge framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By fostering collaborative intelligence, CrewAI empowers agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks.

Crew AI not only endows AI agents with tools and delegation authority but also transforms them into effective partners in problem-solving, creativity, and innovation. Additionally, its integration with Langchain leverages many of Langchainâ€™s abstractions within the framework.

In this implementation, Research, Insight, Writer and Formatter agents are working together sequentially to create a blog post. Here, agents can utilize multiple models through different endpoint URLs to execute tasks and achieve the desired results.

Including an agent that generates an image given a text prompt is still in works.
